Class Documentation
===================

.. py:class:: vectornav.Sensor

    This is the top-level class used by the SDK. In nominal operation, the user will instantiate a sensor object and interact directly with it.

Serial Connectivity Methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    .. py:method:: connect(portName: str | PortName, baudRate: Sensor.BaudRate)
        
        :raises VnError: If the COM port is not accessible.

        Opens the serial port at the specified baud rate and starts the Listening Thread. This does not verify any connectivity, and as such only validates that the serial port is available for opening.
    
    .. py:method:: autoConnect(portName : str | PortName)

        :raises VnError: If the COM port is not accessible or if the unit does not reply to connection verification.

        Opens the serial port and starts the Listening Thread, scanning all possible baud rates until the unit is verified to be connected. This performs a verifySensorConnectivity at each possible baud rate.

    .. py:method:: verifySensorConnectivity() -> bool

        :returns connectivityVerified: Whether a valid response was received from the unit.

        Sends a ReadRegister for the Model register. Returns true if a valid response is received, otherwise returns false.
    
    .. py:method:: connectedPortName() -> optional[str | vectornav.PortName]

        :returns portName: Name of the connected port.

        Gets the port name of the open serial port. If no port is open, will return None.

    .. py:method:: connectedBaudRate() -> optional[Sensor.BaudRate]

        :returns baudRate: BaudRate of the connected port.

        Gets the baud rate at which the serial port is opened. If no port is open, will return None.
    
    .. py:method:: changeBaudRate(newBaudRate: Sensor.BaudRate)

        :raises VnError: If passed a baud rate the system doesn't support or if the unit did not reply to baud rate change command.

        Sends a Write Register for the new baud rate to the unit and reopens to the serial port under the new baud rate. Will retry on failure.

    .. py:method:: changeHostBaudRate()

        :raises VnError: If the host rejected the change baud rate request.

        Changes the host (computer) baud rate without commanding a change to the VectorNav unit's baud rate. Use with caution.
    
    .. py:method:: disconnect()

        Disconnects from the unit and closes the Listening Thread.

    .. py:class:: vectornav.Sensor.BaudRate

        .. py:attribute:: Baud9600
        .. py:attribute:: Baud19200
        .. py:attribute:: Baud38400    
        .. py:attribute:: Baud57600    
        .. py:attribute:: Baud115200    
        .. py:attribute:: Baud128000    
        .. py:attribute:: Baud230400

Measurement Accessor Methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    .. py:method:: hasMeasurement() -> bool

        Checks to see if there is a new measurement available on the MeasurementQueue.
    
    .. py:method:: getNextMeasurement(block: bool) -> Optional[vectornav.CompositeData]

        :param block: If true, wait a maximum of getMeasurementTimeoutLength for a new measurement.

        Gets (and pops) the front of the MeasurementQueue.
    
    .. py:method:: getMostRecentMeasurement(block: bool) -> Optional[vectornav.CompositeData]

        :param block: If true, wait a maximum of getMeasurementTimeoutLength for a new measurement.
