Welcome to VectorNav Python documentation!
==========================================


Migration Guide
---------------
A :doc:`migration guide <pages/migration_guide>` has been provided to highlight the changes between VectorNav's Programming Library and VectorNav's Software Development Kit (SDK).
The fundamental way to interface with the sensor is the same but many features have been updated, and the performance has improved significantly. 

This guide is not a how-to guide but a document of new features and changes between the two software packages. 
Please consult the :doc:`Getting Started example <pages/getting_started>` for how to use the SDK.
