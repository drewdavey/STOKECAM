Getting Started
###############

Overview
========

This is the documentation for the VectorNav Python Software Development Kit

Requirements
============

* Python >= 3.8 64bit
* MSVC >= 2015 on Windows OS
* pybind11

Tested OS
=========
The Python SDK is continually tested on the following hardware/Python combinations:

* Windows 10 : Python 3.11
* Windows 11 : Python 3.11
* Ubuntu 20.04 : Python 3.8

Installation
============

To build and install the VectorNav Python library run the following command from the root folder:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install ./python

.. tip::
    If an installation occurs, pip may need to be upgraded.
    Run the command::

        python -m pip install --upgrade pip 

    Try to reinstall the VNSDK python package to see if error still occurs.
    If so, reach out to VectorNav support for further assistance.

Run getting_started.py
======================

Now that the Python library is installed, lets get data from the sensor. Open the **getting_started.py** file in the ./python/examples/ directory. Notice you can run this file by passing the COM port as a command line argument or by hardcoding the value. The VectorNav USB Adapter will show up in Windows **COMXX** wher **XX** is the number and in Linux as **/dev/ttyUSBX** where **X** is a number (usually 0). Now run the getting_started example:

.. code-block:: console

    python ./python/examples/getting_started.py

Or using the optional command line argument

.. code-block:: console

    python ./python/examples/getting_started.py your_com_port_here
