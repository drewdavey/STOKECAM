VectorNav CLI SDK
#################

The VectorNav CLI SDK provides a software interface to communicate with, configure, and parse the outputs of any VectorNav sensor. 
It contains definitions of the complete protocol of VectorNav register definitions, commands, and measurement outputs, matching the latest ICD. Both synchronous and asynchronous messages are supported, and it is all polling-based.

The CLI SDK wraps the C++ SDK using `C++/CLI <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/dotnet/dotnet-programming-with-cpp-cli-visual-cpp?view=msvc-170>`_ to provide a .NET-accessible dll file for use in MATLAB or C#. Examples in this documentation are given in both C# and MATLAB.

Threaded operation is not currently supported by the CLI library.

Migration Guide
===============
A :doc:`migration guide <pages/MigrationGuide>` has been provided to highlight the changes between VectorNav's Programming Library and VectorNav's Software Development Kit (SDK).
The fundamental way to interface with the sensor is the same but many features have been updated, and the performance has improved significantly. 

This guide is not a how-to guide but a document of new features and changes between the two software packages. 
Please consult the :doc:`Getting Started example <pages/GettingStarted>` for how to use the SDK.
