Simple Logger
#############

The SimpleLogger plugin contains everything necessary to log data from a VectorNav sensor to a binary file.

Usage
=====

To use the SimpleLogger plugin, first import all the necessary modules:

.. code-block:: python

    import vectornav
    from vectornav.Plugins import SimpleLogger

The :py:class:`~vectornav.Plugins.SimpleLogger` requires a :py:class:`~vectornav.ByteBuffer` object and the path of the desired log file. The ByteBuffer is a user-defined buffer where bytes will temporarily be stored before they are written to the log file.

.. code-block:: python

    bufferToLog = ByteBuffer(8192)

    simpleLogger = SimpleLogger(bufferToLog, "log.bin")

Once the ByteBuffer and SimpleLogger class are instatiated, register the ByteBuffer with the sensor object as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    vs.registerReceivedByteBuffer(bufferToLog)

To start logging data from the sensor, you must issue the start method. This creates a new thread that will write data to file when there is enough time to do so. This prevents file write operations from blocking the main thread.

.. code-block:: python

	if (logger.start()):
		print("Error: Failed to write to file")

Ensure that :py:meth:`~vectornav.Plugins.SimpleLogger.start` is succesful, otherwise the logger was not able to create the file. Stopping the logger is just as easy -- just call :py:meth:`~vectornav.Plugins.SimpleLogger.stop` and deregister the ByteBuffer. 

.. code-block:: python

    logger.stop()
    vs.deregisterReceivedByteBuffer()
